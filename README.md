# Data Centre Excess Heat Potential and Cooling Demand

This is a python implementation of the thermodanamic model developed by Alessandro Colangelo for his [Master thesis][Alessandro's thesis].

The original model has been used to, e.g. generate input to TIMES-DK to analyse [the role of data centres in the future Danish energy system][TIMES-DK DC paper].
