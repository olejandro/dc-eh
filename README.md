# ThermoDynamic Model of a Hyperscale Data Centre (HDC-TDM)

This is a python implementation of the thermodanamic model developed by Alessandro Colangelo for his [Master thesis][Alessandro's thesis].

The original model has been used to, e.g. generate input to TIMES-DK to analyse [the role of data centres in the future Danish energy system][TIMES-DK DC paper].

## Using the model

Run `main.py` to execute the model.

`temperature.csv` contains an example of data input.

`output.csv` contains the corresponding output.

Check `dc_model.py` for other assumptions.

## Model description

A description of all model equations is included in Appendix A of [The role of data centres in the future Danish energy system][TIMES-DK DC paper].

Depending on the outdoor air temperature, two cooling modes can be performed: free cooling, through indirect airside economizer, and chiller mode. These are illustrated in the figures below.
